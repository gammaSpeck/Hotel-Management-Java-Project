It is very simple to test this Project.

Prequisites: Have Java and JDK installed in your system

You can run this Project either from an IDE of your choice.
I suggest Eclipse :-)

Or you can run it the old fashined way: Through the Terminal or
cmd. Just open the terminal/cmd and navigate to the folder
where you've downloaded the files.

Type in the following commands:
> javac Hotel.java		
> java Hotel



The javac is the Java Compiler 

If you're running this on a Linux Machine, KUDOS ! 
If you're running this on a windows cmd, it may 
not work if your PATH c]variables may not have been configured.
No worries, in that case just google 
"How to configure PATH variables for java in Windows"


Enjoy :)
